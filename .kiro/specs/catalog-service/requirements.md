# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the Catalog Service component in the e-commerce application. The catalog service manages products, categories, product images, and product variants with a focus on SOLID design principles and clean architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete service layer implementations, so that the catalog functionality is fully operational with proper business logic encapsulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product is created THEN the system SHALL validate all business rules and persist the product with proper relationships
2. WHEN a product is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and update timestamps
3. WHEN a product is deleted THEN the system SHALL handle cascading operations properly
4. WHEN products are queried THEN the system SHALL support filtering, sorting, and pagination efficiently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete repository implementations, so that data access is abstracted and follows repository pattern best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL use repository interfaces to abstract data access
2. WHEN complex queries are needed THEN the system SHALL provide custom query methods
3. WHEN data relationships are involved THEN the system SHALL handle lazy/eager loading appropriately
4. WHEN performance is critical THEN the system SHALL use appropriate indexing and query optimization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete domain model implementations, so that business logic is properly encapsulated in domain entities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain objects are created THEN the system SHALL enforce business invariants
2. WHEN domain operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain object consistency
3. WHEN domain events occur THEN the system SHALL handle state transitions properly
4. WHEN validation is needed THEN the system SHALL use domain-level validation rules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete DTO implementations, so that API contracts are well-defined and data transfer is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL use appropriate request DTOs with validation
2. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL use response DTOs that expose only necessary data
3. WHEN data mapping is needed THEN the system SHALL convert between DTOs and domain objects cleanly
4. WHEN API versioning is considered THEN the system SHALL support backward compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper exception handling, so that errors are managed consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business rule violations occur THEN the system SHALL throw appropriate domain exceptions
2. WHEN data is not found THEN the system SHALL throw not found exceptions with meaningful messages
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation error information
4. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete controller implementations, so that all catalog operations are exposed through REST APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CRUD operations are requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete REST endpoints
2. WHEN bulk operations are needed THEN the system SHALL support batch processing
3. WHEN search functionality is required THEN the system SHALL provide flexible search capabilities
4. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL have well-documented endpoints
